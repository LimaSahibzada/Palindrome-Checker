# Palindrome-Checker 🚀

## Project Description 📝

> this is a Palindrome checker . my first project in javascript 😊 .

I've decided to create a palindrome checker in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because I am inspired by the beauty of linguistic patterns and the challenge of creating a program that detects symmetry in words or phrases. This project allows me to explore the fascinating world of language and coding, blending creativity with logical thinking to build something that detects these intriguing patterns effortlessly. I'm excited to see how this project unfolds!
